# ACL

See [the common ACL specifications](../common/acl).

- `read`: allows a user to read all metadata, the ACL and all non-internal assets (their metadata and the asset files themselves).
- `write`: allows a user to change any editable metadata, change the ACL, change anything about assets (delete, change, add). <sup>TODO: what about internal assets?</sup>

TODO: specify how `listed` works.
